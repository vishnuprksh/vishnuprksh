## üéì Education & Professional Journey

My journey began at **CUSAT, Cochin**, where I pursued my **BTech in Engineering** from 2015 to 2019. During those formative years, I discovered my passion for turning complex problems into elegant solutions through code. But the real transformation started in **2021**, when I embarked on a mission to master the art of **data science**.

Fast forward to **2023**, I joined **Brototype's Data Science & Machine Learning Specialization**, where I dove deep into the world of **artificial intelligence** and **statistical modeling**. This wasn't just learning‚Äîit was a complete immersion into the cutting edge of technology.

As a **freelance Data Scientist**, I've been living at the intersection of **data**, **code**, and **business impact**. I've built and deployed **machine learning models** that run in production environments, solving real-world problems. My work spans from **full-stack application development** to sophisticated **data analysis**, where every insight tells a story and every model makes a difference.

But here's what makes it exciting: I've ventured beyond traditional data science. I **published a mobile game** on the **Google Play Store**, bringing creativity and code together. I've crafted **web applications** powered by data-driven features that users interact with daily. And I've specialized in **financial data analysis** and **trading algorithms**, where milliseconds matter and predictions can change outcomes.

Today, I'm not just analyzing data‚ÄîI'm building the future, one model at a time.
